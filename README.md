# React Boilerplate

A basic React boilerplate with basic configs for:

- Webpack
- eslint
- Jest
- Prettier
- Husky (pre-commit hooks)

## Using the Boilerplate

Clone this boilerplate (without extra history), by doing the following:

1. Run `git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:etyp/react-boilerplate.git NEW-PROJECT-NAME-HERE`
2. Switch into your new project: `cd NEW-PROJECT-NAME-HERE`
3. Clear out old git files: `rm -rf .git`
4. Initialize repository: `git init`
5. Clear out any git leftovers in package.json (anything containing `https://github.com/etyp/react-boilerplate/`)
6. Rename the project `name` from package.json
7. Set up new repo in github (including remotes)
8. Run `npm init -y` to auto-populate git-related fields in package.json

From there you can use the repo as normal.
