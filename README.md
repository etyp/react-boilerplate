# React Boilerplate

A basic React boilerplate with basic configs for:

- Webpack
- eslint
- Jest
- Prettier
- Husky (pre-commit hooks)

## Using the Boilerplate

Clone this boilerplate (without extra history), by doing the following:

1. Run `git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:etyp/react-boilerplate.git NEW-PROJECT-NAME-HERE`
2. Switch into your new project: `cd NEW-PROJECT-NAME-HERE`
3. Clear out old git files: `rm -rf .git`
4. Initialize repository: `git init`

From there you can set up the repo as normal and work off of it.
